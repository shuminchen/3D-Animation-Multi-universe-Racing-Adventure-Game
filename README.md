**level 1**
Racing fish on a grass track.
  There is no time limit for the first level(Seriously, who will take that 500s to complete?). With a starting score of 5, the player needs to reach 10 to win. Red obstacles will   result in -1 score and green ball will have score +1.

**level 2**
Racing car on the race track.
  To win the game, gain at least 5 scores on the road, drive the car towards the destination and hit the red wall to declare victory with 150 seconds. Hitting yellow cones will     gain 1 score; hitting the red cones will lose 1 car health.  If you run out of car health or fall down from the track, you lose this level.

**level 3**
Racing box in the underwater world.
  While you are having an undersea exploration, please be careful about the danger around you. If you hit the grey stone, the wellness score will be deduced by 1. If you hit the     red cone, congratulations, health score will be increased by 1. The sound effect will remind you of the things you hit. To win this game, you should gain 15 points on the health   score. If you run out of time, or the wellness score gets too low, you will lose the game.

**level 5**
  Race in the Bayanbulak mountains where you could face challenges like cliff edges, randomly falling rocks and poisoned spots. Even more, there is 30s time limit and no           remedies for your wellness and health. Only bravery can help you win!
